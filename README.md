## About The Project:
As a frisbee player, I was interested to see the rise and fall of teams in each region over the years.
To get a better sense of the ultimate frisbee dynasties and other fun stats, I scraped data from the USAU archives of nationals and then built this dashboard.


## How To Use:
* Use the filters to pick a division, a sub-division, and a region.
* Use checkboxes in the summary table to pick which teams to show in the graphs.
* The graphs will update automatically and can be hovered over for more information.

### Notes
* Divisions are named based on current USAU naming except in the case of college where there are separate
sub divisions for before and after the DI/DIII separation
* Where possible, historical regions for teams are updated to the region they currently play in. However, due to regional boundary redrawing, the regions of teams may change over the years.
* From 2000-2013, spirit scores were on a 1-5 scale. After 2013, the WFDF system of 0-20 was adopted. The scores from 2013 and before have been linearly scaled to the WFDF system.
