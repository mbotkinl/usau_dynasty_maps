## About the project
As a frisbee player, I was interested to see the rise and fall of teams in each region over the years.
To get a better sense of the ultimate frisbee dynasties and other fun stats, I scraped data from the USAU archives of nationals and then built this dashboard.


## How to use
* Use the selection filters to pick a division, a sub-division, and a region
* Use checkboxes in the summary table to pick which teams to show in the graphs
* The graphs will update automatically and can be hovered over for more information

### Notes
* Divisions are named based on current USAU naming except in the case of college where there are separate
sub divisions for before and after the DI/DIII separation
* Due to regional boundary redrawing, the regional of teams change over the years
